# Project 2 - Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using PyTorch

## Project Overview
 
This project aims to develop an image classification model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using a pre-trained ResNet-18 model in PyTorch. It classifies the X-ray images into one of three categories: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, or COVID-19. The main objective is to develop a working image classification model capable of predicting the correct class for a given chest X-ray scan with a reasonable level of accuracy. Additionally, this project is a hands-on implementation, focusing on the practical aspects of building the model, rather than the theoretical concepts behind Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Dataset

Weâ€™ll be working with the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset, which contains nearly 3,000 chest X-ray scans categorized into the three classes. This project uses this dataset solely for educational purposes and is not intended for medical diagnosis.
